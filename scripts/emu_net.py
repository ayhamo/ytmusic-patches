"""Turn the test emulator's network off and on, for offline tests.

    python scripts/emu_net.py status
    python scripts/emu_net.py on                        # network back on now (and cancel the watchdog)
    python scripts/emu_net.py off [--minutes N]         # airplane mode on; back on by itself after N min (default 3)
    python scripts/emu_net.py run TEST.sh [--minutes N] [--out DIR]

On LDPlayer, airplane mode also cuts adb's shell (adb devices still lists the emulator, but every
shell command hangs) until the network is back. So an offline test has to run on the emulator
itself: `run` pushes TEST.sh, starts it there under a watchdog, and checks every 10 s with a hard
time limit. TEST.sh turns airplane mode on, does its taps, writes its screenshots/logs to
/sdcard/offtest, turns airplane mode off and writes /sdcard/offtest/finished. Whatever TEST.sh
does, the watchdog turns the network back on after N minutes. `run` then stops the watchdog and
pulls /sdcard/offtest into --out.

Only ever talks to emulator-5558, never to a phone.
