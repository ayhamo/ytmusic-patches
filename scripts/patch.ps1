# Patches YouTube Music with the official Morphe bundle + our bundle, the same way Morphe Manager does,
# and optionally installs it on the emulator.
#
# Patch selection:
# - Morphe bundle: all 51 YouTube Music patches (Morphe's defaults + "Network proxy", which is off by default).
#   The 5 universal patches (Clone app, Change installer source, Override certificate pinning,
#   Spoof signature, Disable Play Store updates) stay off, as they are by default.
# - Our bundle: its defaults.
# Signing: Morphe's default shared keystore in work/morphe-data (alias/password "Morphe", same as Manager),
# so every build installs over the previous one.
